## Executive Summary
From the mtcars data set, it can be concluded that the automatic transmissions have better MPG than the manual ones. The mean MPG are 17.15 and 24.39 for automatic and manual transmissions respectively, with the automatic transmission car 7.24 lower than the manual ones. Analyzing the fitting coefficients and the residuals also supports the trend and conclusion are trustworthy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Looking at the mtcars data, we see that outcome "mpg" is continuous number, and the input "am" is binary - 0 for automatic transmission and 1 for manual transmission. We should use linear regression to fit the relationship.

First, we do an exploratory data analysis by plotting out the boxplot of "mpg" vs. "am", as in figure 1. The plot shows a distinct mpg difference between the manual and auto transmission. The mpg mean of the cars with automatic transmission is 17.15, while that of the cars with manual transmission is 24.39. A further T test on the mpg for automatic and manual transmission shows that the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the automatic cars, which is 19.00, is lower than the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the manual cars, which is 20.67. It's a clear indication that the mpg of the automatic transmission car is lower than that of the manual transmission car.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
